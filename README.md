# Yolo-v3-from-scratch

##Implementing yolo v3 from scratch in pytorch

* YOLO can only detect objects belonging to the classes present in the dataset used to train the network. In this repsitory we will be using the official weight file for our detector. These weights have been obtained by training the network on COCO dataset, and therefore we can detect 80 object categories.
